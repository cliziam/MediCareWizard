# **MediCareWizard**

Nowadays, modern booking systems are capable of making our lives easier by
facilitating getting an appointment and speeding up the time needed for it.<br>
With the idea in mind to avoid the potential long queues we can face when needing
to book a medical visit, we decided to create MediCareWizard: a system for booking
medical appointments at the patient’s fingertips.<br>
MediCareWizard aids the patients in need of a specialist’s examination or a medical
service by creating an easy to use, fast and immediate system to satisfy their needs,
with the aim of guaranteeing a quality service and short waiting times within our
diagnostic medical center.

## **Roadmap**

In order to create a secure and scalable solution we decided to use the AWS Cloud
Platform, which proved to be a valid service for our purpose.
To allow users to choose, book, delete or modify an appointment, we must provide a
web interface: to develop this interface we use some technologies such as html, css, js
and Bootstrap in order to create a responsive website.
All the features were implemented inside Amazon Web Services as microservices:
users can interact with the website, using indirectly AWS microservices to book,
delete and modify appointments.

## **Technologies Used**
● HTML5 + CSS + (JavaScript+ Jquery) + Bootstrap <br>
● Amazon S3 Bucket<br>
● AWS DynamoDB<br>
● AWS Lambda<br>
● AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)<br>
● Amazon API Gateway<br>
● Amazon CloudWatch<br>
